### Test Execution Report

#### 1. Python Code: Calculator Functionality

- **File Tested:** `./src/calculator.py`
- **Test File:** `test/calculator_test.py`
- **Test Results:**
  - **Total Tests:** 10
  - **Passed:** 10
  - **Failed:** 0
- **Summary:** All tests for the calculator functionality passed successfully. The tests covered a range of scenarios including basic arithmetic operations, division by zero, unsupported operations, floating-point inputs, negative inputs, zero inputs, and large numbers. This indicates that the calculator function behaves as expected across a variety of input conditions.

#### 2. JavaScript Code: Array Processor Functionality

- **File Tested:** `./src/js/array_processor.js`
- **Test File:** `test/array_processor_test.js`
- **Test Results:** Execution failed with exit code 4.
- **Summary:** The test execution for the array processor functionality did not proceed as expected. No tests were collected or executed, indicating a potential issue with the test setup or environment for JavaScript testing.

#### Recommendations:

1. **Calculator Functionality (Python):** Given the successful test outcomes, the calculator functionality appears to be robust and reliable. No further action is required unless new functionality is added or significant changes are made to the existing code.

2. **Array Processor Functionality (JavaScript):**
   - **Investigate Test Environment:** The failure to execute tests for the array processor suggests an issue with the test environment setup for JavaScript. Ensure that the necessary testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha) are correctly installed and configured.
   - **Review Test File:** Verify that the test file `test/array_processor_test.js` is correctly implemented and that it follows the conventions expected by the testing framework in use.
   - **Retry Test Execution:** After addressing the potential issues with the test environment and test file, attempt to execute the tests again.

#### Next Steps:

For the array processor functionality, the immediate next step is to resolve the issues preventing test execution. This may involve reviewing and updating the project's JavaScript testing setup, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly installed, and that the test scripts are correctly configured to find and execute the tests in `test/array_processor_test.js`.

Once the issue has been resolved and the tests can be executed, a detailed analysis of the test outcomes will be necessary to ensure the array processor behaves as expected across a range of scenarios, including error handling and edge cases.
